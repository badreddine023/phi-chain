- Superposition-Based Proof-of-Coherence (PoC) consensus
- Reversible transactions with temporal symmetry
- Mathematical purity eliminating arbitrary parameters

## 1. Introduction
### 1.1 The Problem with Arbitrary Blockchain Design
- Current blockchains use arbitrary parameters (block times, validator counts)
- Lack of mathematical foundation leads to inefficiencies
- Need for cosmic law-based architecture

### 1.2 The Φ-Chain Solution
- All parameters derived from Fibonacci sequence (F_n), Lucas numbers (L_n), and φ
- Quantum-classical bridge through superposition-based consensus
- Complete temporal reversibility without data loss

## 2. Mathematical Foundations
### 2.1 The Golden Ratio (φ ≈ 1.618)
- Mathematical properties and significance
- Eigenvalue analysis of Fibonacci Q-Matrix
- Natural occurrence in biological and physical systems

### 2.2 Fibonacci Sequence Properties
- Recursive definition: F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)
- Negative Fibonacci: F(-n) = (-1)^(n+1) * F(n)
- Zeckendorf representation for unique decomposition

### 2.3 Lucas Numbers and Extended Sequences
- L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2), L(0)=2, L(1)=1
- Relationship to Fibonacci: L(n) = F(n-1) + F(n+1)
- Applications in validator selection and economic models

## 3. Consensus Mechanism: Fibonacci Byzantine Agreement (FBA)
### 3.1 Traditional Byzantine Fault Tolerance Limitations
