## 🚀 Performance & Scalability

Φ-Chain is engineered for high-performance decentralized computing, utilizing mathematical constants to optimize every layer of the stack.

| Metric | Value | Derivation | Impact |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Block Time** | 1.618s | $\phi$ seconds | Ultra-low latency transaction finality. |
| **Throughput** | 1,000+ TPS | OPEVM | Parallel execution via Optimistic EVM. |
| **Initial Shards** | 21 | $F_8$ | Distributed data partitions for scalability. |
| **Finality** | < 3s | PoC | Superposition-based coherence collapse. |

### ⚡ Optimistic Parallelized EVM (OPEVM)
By using static analysis to detect state conflicts before execution, Φ-Chain achieves high throughput while maintaining full compatibility with the Ethereum ecosystem.

## 🛡️ The Triangle of Trust

All transactions are secured by a three-point verification system:
1. **Sender**: Initiates the $\phi$-quantized transaction.
2. **Receiver**: Validates the cryptographic entanglement.
3. **Validator**: Acts as the mathematically-pure point, enforcing **Proof-of-Coherence (PoC)**.

## 🛠️ Technical Components ("The Staff")

### 🧬 Core Engine (`phi_chain.py`)
The heart of the system, implementing Fibonacci Q-Matrix state transitions and the unified consensus engine.

### 🤖 AI Oracle Bridge (`api/wallet_api.py`)
A secure, decentralized connection between on-chain smart contracts and off-chain AI models, enabling the **Symbiotic AI** to act as the "Observer."

### 📊 Interactive Dashboard (`consensus-monitor.html`)
Real-time monitoring of network health, validator performance, and Fibonacci convergence charts.

### 🔐 Validator Node (`validator_node.py`)
Complete implementation with key management, block proposal, and reward tracking based on the **Coherence Score**.
